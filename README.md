# Bluey
This game is made using Godot Engine and as I try to learn how to code using Godot again. This is merely a demo and can't be used as a proof that I'm good at Godot since the lines of code here are 
copied and modified from Brackey's video on how to make video games using Godot.

# Notes
This repo is just for reference for my future project that I'm currently planning. THIS IS NOT PROOF that I know how to properly code Godot on my own, the next self-project will be the one
where I'll showcase it.

# Credits
I would like to thank Brackeys for his amazing tutorial as always and Kenney.nl for the amazing free assets that I used for this small project.
